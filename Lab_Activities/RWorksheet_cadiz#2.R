##Using Vectors

## 1. Create a vector using : operator

#a. Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output. Describe its output.
num_vector <- -5:5
print(num_vector)
#In this code the sequence will start from the negative five to the positive five, 
#with the help of the ";" operator it states that the origin will start at
#negative five and will end to positive five.

#b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
#The value of the x will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

## 2. Create a vector using seq() function

#a. seq(1,3, by=0.2) #specify step size
#Write the R script and its output. Describe the output.
nseq <- seq(1,3, by=0.2)
print(nseq)
# The output shows that the it will start to number one and it will increment by 
#0.2 until it reaches to number 3.
